# test-june16

My name is Luke Miall and I have recently joined the Media Team in the Operations Centre in Exeter as a Media Operational Meteorologist. I have previously worked as an embedded meteorologist at Aberporth, the Hebrides, RAF Coningsby and at Highways England in Birmingham. I have had a keen interest in the weather since I young age and have recorded weather observations in my garden for many years. I am looking forward to getting stuck in to a new challenge on the Media Team and I can't wait to start producing the online videos.
